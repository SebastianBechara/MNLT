IMPORTANT!!!

I cannot upload anything bigger than ~25 - 30 mb to my github account. I will upload a version with out big files. These are mainly the testData directory and the res directory. You'll need to copy these from the uni IZB server. The full toolset is uploaded here: smb://nas-izb.unibe.ch/groups/IZB_Groups/Nowacki/BioinformaticTools/MNLT
